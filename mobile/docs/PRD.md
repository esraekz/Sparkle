Product Vision

Sparkle is an AI personal-branding copilot that learns your voice, watches trusted news, and proactively drafts posts—then asks for your approval to publish (immediately or at a suggested time).
It starts with LinkedIn, helping professionals build authentic, consistent visibility without the creative burnout.

“Sparkle helps professionals consistently share authentic, high-quality content on LinkedIn — without spending hours brainstorming, drafting, or keeping up with trends.”

“Unlike other AI post generators, Sparkle continuously learns your tone and engagement patterns, acting as a true long-term branding copilot — not a one-off content tool.”

 

Core System Components

Onboarding — Brand Blueprint & Preferences

When users join for the first time, Sparkle builds a personal brand blueprint by asking:

What topics are you interested in? (e.g., IT, AI, Finance, Leadership)

What’s your main goal? (e.g., Become a Top Voice, Increase visibility, Attract headhunters)

Which top voices or creators inspire you?

What tone best represents you? (e.g., Warm, Assertive, Innovative)

Posting preferences (cadence, “ask before publish,” preferred days/hours)

This ensures all future AI content reflects the user’s personal brand identity and objectives.

 

AI Brain — Voice Learning & Knowledge Memory

Sparkle evolves with each interaction, combining personalization and contextual awareness.

Voice Learning

Analyzes your past posts to learn tone, phrasing, and structure.

Adapts based on engagement (likes, comments → improved suggestions).

Learns from user edits — each approved or modified draft refines Sparkle’s tone model.

Knowledge & RAG Memory

Stores past posts, trends, and trusted news sources.

Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context-aware drafting.

Adds traceable citations for news-driven content.

Continuous Adaptation

Posts that perform well reinforce their tone and topic weighting.

Sparkle maintains a memory of what works best for your audience.

 

Proactive AI & Notifications

Sparkle behaves like a real assistant — always one step ahead:

Sends push notifications when a trending topic fits your interest areas.

Provides a weekly “content health check” (e.g., “You’ve posted 1 of 3 times this week — here’s a trending idea.”).

Suggests real-time actions (“It’s your best posting hour — want to share something now?”).

Periodically drafts posts automatically based on news relevance or engagement gaps.

This proactive behavior makes Sparkle a true copilot, not just a tool.
